# modeltests

`modeltests` is a package that exports tests for use other packages. Currently I'm experimenting with moving the core broom tests into `modeltests`. This will allow other developers to guarantee that their tidier implementations that meet the broom `tidy()`, `glance()` and `augment()` specifications.

Example use:

- The [`dustpan`]https://github.com/alexpghayes/dustpan) package is a small demonstration of how to use `modeltests` and `modelgenerics`
- See the test suite in [`broom`](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom)

A detailed vignette is in progress in broom as well.
