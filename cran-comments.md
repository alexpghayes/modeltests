## modeltests

This submission extends the argument and column glossaries used for unit
testing in modeling packages to accomodate the upcoming broom release.

## Test environments

* local OS X install: R 3.6
* win-builder: oldrel, rel, devel
* rhub: oldrel, rel, devel

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs.

## Downstream dependencies

I have also run R CMD check on the one downstream dependency of modeltests,
ItemResponseTrees, and the package passes with no ERRORs, WARNINGs, or
NOTEs.
